Description: A set of tools for performing sparse Gaussian graphical model (joint, multiple and difference) estimation from high dimensional dataset. It contains a general purpose visualization function as well as a specialized function for 3d brain network. Simulation and evaluation modules are available. It also contains a simple GUI built in shiny for easy graph visualization. Methods include SIMULE (Wang B et al. (2017) <doi:10.1007/s10994-017-5635-7>), WSIMULE (Singh C et al. (2017) <arXiv:1709.04090v2>), DIFFEE (Wang B et al. (2018) <arXiv:1710.11223>), FASJEM (Wang B et al. (2018) <arXiv:1702.02715v3>), JEEK (Wang B et al. (2018) <arXiv:1806.00548>) and DIFFEEK (Wang B et al, under final review for publication).
