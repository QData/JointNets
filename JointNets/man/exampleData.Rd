\description{
A simulated toy dataset that includes 2 data matrices (from 2 related
tasks). Each data matrix is about 100 features observed in 200 samples. The
two data matrices are about exactly the same set of 100 features. This
multi-task dataset is generated from two related random graphs. Please run
demo(diffee) to learn the basic functions provided by this package.  For
further details, please read the original paper:
